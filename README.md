# Exploratory_Analysis_Project



1. Three decade analysis - Sakshi
 
 -- Filter by year (2010 - 2020)
 
2. Group by region to see if some regions are different from others - Sakshi
3. How many are multiple offenses vs single? - Abbie
4. Possibly get mean, std, and max for victim_count - Abbie


Other points to explore
- stats 
- 2-3 visuals

To Do :
  1. Come up with at least one hypothesis or question about your data and no more than five. Example: What is the relationship between airline stocks and covid cases?

  2. Store your data to check your hypothesis/answer your question(s) in one or more Pandas dataframes. Be concise and document your code clearly.2. 

  3. Create 2-3 visuals per hypothesis or question, and use basic statistics to explore your data. There is not only one right answer for how to explore your data.

  4. Create a presentation that is 5-8 minutes, which explains your findings. You will be giving this presentation on the due date.

## Deliverables
You must submit a link to your group github repository with:

  1. A jupyter notebook with all your analysis and visualizations in it.

  2. A ppt presentation with at least 4 slides and no more than 15.

AND you will be presenting your PowerPoint presentation in 5-8 minutes on the due date. Longer presentations are not necessarily better. It must stay under 8 minutes.

Guidelines for your notebook:
  - Write up an executive summary of your findings using markdown.
  - Use markdown throughout your notebook to tell the story of your data.
  - All graphs should have Titles, labels and matching color schemes where applicable.
  - Code should be neat and well documented.
  - Use different types of graphs
